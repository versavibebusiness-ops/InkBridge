## Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

Due to Windows PowerShell execution policy restrictions, you'll need to:

1. Run PowerShell as Administrator (if possible) and execute:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```

2. Then install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Alternatively, you can double-click the `setup.bat` file to run the installation.

### 2. Run the Development Server

After installing dependencies:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or double-click the `dev.bat` file to start the development server.

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 3. Explore the Application

Navigate through the different pages:
- Home page with platform overview
- Publish page with book submission forms
- Browse page with sample books
- Community page with author features
- Resources page with writing guides
- Authentication pages (login/signup)

## Future Enhancements

This is a frontend-only implementation. For a complete platform, you would need to add:

1. **Backend API** - For user authentication, book management, and data storage
2. **Database** - To store user information, books, and community content
3. **User Profiles** - For authors to showcase their work
4. **Book Reader** - To read published books directly on the platform
5. **Payment Integration** - For book sales and author payouts
6. **Search Functionality** - Advanced book discovery features
7. **Review System** - For readers to rate and review books

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the `DEVELOPMENT.md` file for detailed troubleshooting steps
2. Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed on your system
3. Make sure npm is available in your command line
4. If Windows execution policy is blocking scripts, refer to the development guide
